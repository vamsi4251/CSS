What are Pseudo-classes?
        A pseudo-class is used to define a special state of an element.

        For example, it can be used to:
            Style an element when a user mouses over it
            Style visited and unvisited links differently
            Style an element when it gets focus
        
        Syntax
            selector:pseudo-class {
                property: value;
            }

    :hover Selector --- 
        The :hover selector is used to select elements when you mouse over them.
        The :hover selector can be used on all elements, not only on links.
        :hover MUST come after :link and :visited (if they are present) in the CSS definition, in order to be effective!
        
        CSS Syntax
            :hover {
                css declarations;
            }

    :link Selector ---
            The :link selector is used to select unvisited links.
            Note: The :link selector does not style links you have already visited.
            
            CSS Syntax
                :link {
                    css declarations;
                }
    :visited Selector ---
            The :visited selector is used to select visited links.

            Tip: Use the :link selector to style links to unvisited pages, the :hover selector to style links when you mouse over them, and the :active selector to style links when you click on them.

            Browsers limits the styles that can be set for a:visited links, due to security issues.

    :active Selector  ---
            The :active selector is used to select and style the active link.

            A link becomes active when you click on it.
        
            Tip: The :active selector can be used on all elements, not only links.
        
            Tip: Use the :link selector to style links to unvisited pages, the :visited selector to style links to visited pages, and the :hover selector to style links when you mouse over them.
        
            Note: :active MUST come after :hover (if present) in the CSS definition in order to be effective!
    
    :target Selector ---
            URLs with an # followed by an anchor name link to a certain element within a document. The element being linked to is the target element.

            The :target selector can be used to style the current active target element.

    :focus Selector ---
            The :focus selector is used to select the element that has focus.
            Tip: The :focus selector is allowed on elements that accept keyboard events or other user inputs.
