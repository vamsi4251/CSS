<!-- CSS Selectors ----
        CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.
        We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
            
            Simple selectors (select elements based on tagname, id, class)
            Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
            Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
            Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
            Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)


    Simple selectors ---
        id Selector ---
            The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element.
            The id of an element is unique within a page, so the id selector is used to select one unique element!
            To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character

        class Selector ---
            The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute.    
            To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.

        Universal Selector ---
            The universal selector (*) selects all HTML elements on the page.

        Grouping Selector ---
            The grouping selector selects all the HTML elements with the same style definitions.
            It will be better to group the selectors, to minimize the code.
            To group selectors, separate each selector with a comma.

    Combinator selectors ---
        There are four different combinators in CSS:

            descendant selector (space)
            child selector (>)
            adjacent sibling selector (+)
            general sibling selector (~)

        Descendant Selector ---
            The descendant selector matches all elements that are descendants of a specified element.
        Child Selector (>) ---
            The child selector selects all elements that are the children of a specified element.
        Adjacent Sibling Selector (+) ---
            The adjacent sibling selector is used to select an element that is directly after another specific element.
            Sibling elements must have the same parent element, and "adjacent" means "immediately following".
        General Sibling Selector (~) ---
            The general sibling selector selects all elements that are next siblings of a specified element.
