<!-- CSS Transitions ---
        CSS transitions allows you to change property values smoothly, over a given duration.

How to Use CSS Transitions?
        To create a transition effect, you must specify two things:

        the CSS property you want to add an effect to
        the duration of the effect
        If the duration part is not specified, the transition will have no effect, because the default value is 0.

Syntax ---

    transition :  transition-property transition-duration transition-timing-function transition-delay;

properties ---

        there are mainly 4 properties
            
            transition-property
            transition-duration
            transition-timing-function
            transition-delay

    transition-timing-function ---
        The transition-timing-function property specifies the speed curve of the transition effect.
        The transition-timing-function property can have the following values:
        
            ease - specifies a transition effect with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly (this is default)
            linear - specifies a transition effect with the same speed from start to end
            ease-in - specifies a transition effect with a slow start
            ease-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow end
            ease-in-out - specifies a transition effect with a slow start and end
        
    transition-delay ---
        The transition-delay property specifies a delay (in seconds) for the transition effect.
